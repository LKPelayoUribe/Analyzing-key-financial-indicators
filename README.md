Statistical Modeling for Data Analytics - This research paper provides an analysis of key stock indicators and whether can they be used to predict next-day closing prices, with the following models:

- Linear regression
- Lasso regression 
- Ridge regression
- Generalized additive (GAM)

***Disclaimer:** We are aware that we violated the assumption that our observations are not independent. Be aware these models need to be taken with a grain of salt and not be used for day trading.*

## Datasource and approach

## Linear regression

## Lasso regression

## Ridge regression

## GAM

## Conclusion
Our team has evaluated four different models that can be used to predict the closing price of bitcoin. After looking at the test mse scores of the four models we have concluded that the GAM model which used natural splines was able to report a MSE of 2.4589802 Ã— 106 a MAE of 969.4837132 and an r-squared of 0.9916912.
